Welcome to the **wrfup** documentation! This tool allows users to efficiently integrate real-world, high-resolution urban morphology data into WRF simulations. It provides key functionalities for downloading, calculating, and ingesting urban fields into WRF geo_em files. By using wrfup, users can enhance the accuracy of urban weather simulations with support for urban parameterizations like SLUCM, BEP, and BEP+BEM.
